One-Dimensional Planar Flame
----------------------------------------


**Problem Description**


The case simulates the steady-state 1D freely-propagating flame. The results are able to catch the flame thickness, laminar fame speed and the detailed 1D flame structure. This case demonstrate that the convection-diffusion-reaction algorithms implemented in our solver are stable and accurate.

Two-Dimensional Flame in Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence
----------------------------------------------------------

**Problem Description**

2D reacting flow with homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) is simulated here. It can be used to simulate kinetic energy dissapation and qualitatively assess turbulence effects on combustion under the circumstances that 3D simulations are computationally prohibitive.

The domain is initially filled with CH4/air mixture with an equivalence ratio of 0.6 at atmospheric pressure. To initialize 2d HIT simulations, turbulence is generated follwing the procedure described by Vuorinen and Keskinen.
